<!-- Inline Vs Block  Element


Block-Level- Element 

A block-level element always starts
on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before
and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available 

 Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.-->
